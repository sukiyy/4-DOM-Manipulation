DOM Manipulation

Goals
-Learn about the DOM (Document Object Model) and how to use it to find and modify HTML on a webpage
-Learn about Event-Driven Programming, for instance, how JavaScript and HTML interact when you click on a button
-Projects & Exercises:

To apply these skills hands-on:

At the end of the Manipulating the DOM subunit, there will be an exercise where you select, add, delete, create, modify, append, and loop HTML elements
You'll have a project making a card matching memory game
You’ll have a project using local storage in your browser to make an interactive TO-DO list
Now that you’ve got a good grasp of Web Fundamentals, this unit is where the fun begins. You’ll explore how JavaScript interacts with HTML on a browser through a tool called the DOM. You’ll begin by creating lightweight web applications that respond to on-screen events like a mouse click. The rest of the section builds off of material you'll learn in this unit and DOM manipulation is an extremely common task in the workplace.

 

By the end of this unit, you'll see that you have so much potential inside you to create amazing applications online. You're just starting out coding, and you can already make interactive games! Just imagine what kind of beautiful software you'll be able to create by the end of the course. Sky's the limit!
 
Both of the projects you'll complete in this unit can go into your portfolio. 
 
To check your progress, and show you a bit more of the possibilities available at your fingertips, you'll take your first assessment after you complete this unit. You'll be using everything you learned in this unit to make a simple web app that generates memes!  We'll have more instructions for you once you get to the assessment, see you on the other side.
